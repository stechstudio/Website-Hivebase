<h1>RESELLER ADDENDUM</h1>
<p>(to Hivebase Terms of Service)</p>
<p>This Reseller Addendum (“Addendum”) forms part of, and is governed by, the Hivebase Terms of Service (“Base Terms”). It is binding between:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Signature Tech Studio, Inc.,</strong> a North Carolina corporation (“Company”); and  </li>
 <li>The legal entity whose full company name is entered in the acceptance fields at the bottom of this Addendum (“Reseller”).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Effective Date.</strong>  The “Effective Date” is the earliest of (a) the date Reseller clicks “I Agree” or otherwise electronically accepts this Addendum, (b) the date Reseller places an Order that references this Addendum, or (c) the date Reseller first resells or bundles the Services after being presented with this Addendum.</p>
<p>By accepting this Addendum, Reseller confirms that it has read and agrees to be bound by its terms and by the Base Terms.</p>
<h2>1. DEFINITIONS  </h2>
<p>1.1 <strong>“Base Terms”</strong> means the Hivebase Terms of Service (“ToS”) in effect on the Effective Date, as amended from time to time in accordance with § 13 of the ToS.  </p>
<p>1.2 <strong>“Customer”</strong> means an end user that accesses the Services under a subscription provisioned by Reseller.  </p>
<p>1.3 <strong>“Services”</strong> has the meaning given in the Base Terms and includes any associated documentation and support.  </p>
<p>1.4 <strong>“Order”</strong> means an electronic or written order Reseller submits to Company for workspaces, seats or other upgrades.  </p>
<p>1.5 Capitalised terms not defined in this Addendum have the meanings given in the Base Terms.</p>
<h2>2. SCOPE; ORDERING  </h2>
<p>2.1 <strong>Appointment.</strong> Subject to this Addendum, Company appoints Reseller as a non-exclusive reseller of the Services.  </p>
<p>2.2 <strong>Workspace Purchases.</strong>  Reseller shall purchase workspaces from Company under each Order and may resell or bundle those to Customers at prices determined by Reseller.  </p>
<p>2.3 <strong>No Authority to Bind Company.</strong>  Reseller is an independent contractor and may not make any commitment on Company’s behalf.  </p>
<h2>3. CUSTOMER ONBOARDING &amp; FLOW-DOWN TERMS  </h2>
<p>3.1  <strong>Customer Acceptance of Base Terms</strong>  </p>
<p>The Hivebase application requires every end user to accept the Base Terms and Privacy Policy at first login; Company is responsible for collecting and recording that acceptance.  <strong>Reseller is solely responsible for establishing and enforcing any separate commercial or service-level terms between Reseller and its Customer, provided that such terms do not conflict with the Base Terms or this Addendum.</strong></p>
<p>3.2 <strong>No Additional Warranties.</strong>  Reseller shall not make any representation or warranty about the Services that is inconsistent with or in addition to the Base Terms or this Addendum.  </p>
<p>3.3 <strong>Scanning &amp; Physical Documents.</strong>  If Reseller performs scanning, digitisation, or document-preparation services, Reseller is solely responsible for the physical documents and any loss or damage thereto.  Company bears no liability for physical document handling.</p>
<p>3.4 <strong>Customer Content Ownership and Agency.</strong></p>
<p>(a)  Ownership.  As between Company, Reseller, and each Customer, all right, title, and interest in Customer Content (including documents digitised and uploaded by Reseller) remain with the Customer or its licensors.  Reseller makes no ownership claim to such Customer Content.  </p>
<p>(b)  Agency.  When Reseller uploads or otherwise processes Customer Content in a Customer workspace, Reseller acts solely as that Customer’s agent.  Reseller represents and warrants that it has all rights and permissions required to grant Company the licence described in § 2.3 of the Base Terms on the Customer’s behalf.  </p>
<p>(c)  Conflicting Instructions.  If Company receives conflicting instructions from Reseller and the Customer regarding Customer Content, Company may, at its sole discretion, follow the Customer’s instructions, require joint written direction, or suspend access to the disputed Content until the conflict is resolved.  </p>
<p>(d)  Indemnity.  Reseller will indemnify and hold harmless Company from any claim alleging that Reseller lacked authority to upload or process Customer Content or that Reseller’s handling of physical documents violated a third party’s rights.</p>
<h2>4. FEES &amp; PAYMENT  </h2>
<p>4.1 <strong>Plan Selection</strong></p>
<p>At onboarding (or later in the Reseller Console) Reseller must choose one of the following billing plans for each reseller account:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Monthly Auto-Billing Plan</strong> (default)  </li>
 <li><strong>Annual Invoicing Plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The selected plan applies to all workspaces Reseller provisions under that reseller account until Reseller switches plans in the Reseller Console (switches take effect at the next renewal).</p>
<p>“Minimum Commitment” means the minimum spend per billing period displayed in the Reseller Console, if any.</p>
<p>4.2 <strong>Monthly Auto-Billing Plan</strong></p>
<p>(a) <strong>Payment Method.</strong>  Reseller must maintain a valid credit-card or ACH payment method on file.  </p>
<p>(b) <strong>Charge Schedule.</strong>  Company will charge the payment method on or after the first business day of each calendar month for (i) the greater of actual usage fees or the Minimum Commitment for the preceding month, plus (ii) applicable taxes.  </p>
<p>(c) <strong>Failed Payments.</strong>  If a charge is declined, Reseller has seven (7) days to update the payment method; otherwise late-fee and suspension provisions in § 5 of the Base Terms apply.</p>
<p>4.3 <strong>Annual Invoicing Plan</strong></p>
<p>(a) <strong>Up-Front Invoice.</strong>  For each new workspace Reseller activates, Company will issue an invoice for a 12-month subscription at the then-current wholesale price.  </p>
<p>(b) <strong>Renewal Invoice.</strong>  Company will issue a renewal invoice thirty (30) days before each workspace’s annual renewal date.  </p>
<p>(c) <strong>Payment Terms.</strong>  Invoices are due net thirty (30) days from the invoice date.  </p>
<p>(d) <strong>Minimum Commitment.</strong>  If a Minimum Commitment applies, Company will reconcile Reseller’s cumulative annual spend against that commitment at the end of each contract year and invoice any shortfall.</p>
<p>4.4 <strong>Pricing &amp; Minimum Commitment Changes</strong></p>
<p>Wholesale prices and any Minimum Commitment applicable to Reseller are displayed in the Reseller Console. Company may update these amounts on at least thirty (30) days’ written notice. Continued resale of the Services after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</p>
<p>4.5 <strong>Taxes, Late Fees &amp; Interest</strong></p>
<p>Tax obligations, late-fee calculations, and interest on overdue amounts are governed by § 5 of the Base Terms.</p>
<p>4.6 <strong>No Offset</strong></p>
<p>Reseller’s payment obligations to Company are independent of Reseller’s collection from Customers.  Reseller may not withhold or offset amounts owed to Company for any reason.</p>
<p>4.7 <strong>Price Protection</strong></p>
<p>(a) <strong>Standard Lock (12 Months).</strong>  The wholesale price in effect for a workspace on its activation date is locked for twelve (12) months.  Company may not increase that workspace’s wholesale price during the 12-month lock.</p>
<p>(b)  <strong>Extended Lock (Up to 36 Months).</strong>  </p>
<p>If Reseller enters a customer contract term longer than 12 months, Reseller may flag the workspace in the Reseller Console within thirty (30) days of activation and record the contract-end date (which may not exceed thirty-six (36) months after activation).  The wholesale price for that workspace is then locked until the earlier of (i) the recorded contract-end date or (ii) thirty-six (36) months after activation.  </p>
<p>If the workspace is cancelled before its recorded contract-end date, Reseller shall pay an early-termination fee equal to the lesser of (A) three (3) months of wholesale fees for that workspace, or (B) the wholesale fees that would have been due for the remainder of the recorded contract term.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Post-Lock Pricing.</strong>  After the applicable price-lock period ends, the workspace will renew at the then-current wholesale price unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Minimum Commitment Unaffected.</strong>  Price protection applies per workspace and does not alter Reseller’s Minimum Commitment, if any.</p>
<p>(e) <strong>Notice of Change.</strong>  Company will continue to provide at least thirty (30) days’ notice of any wholesale price increase, but such increase will not take effect for a protected workspace until its lock period expires.</p>
<h2>5. SUPPORT &amp; SERVICE LEVELS</h2>
<p>5.1 <strong>First-Line Support.</strong>  Reseller provides first-line support to its Customers.  Company will provide second-line support to Reseller during business hours at no additional charge.  </p>
<p>5.2 <strong>Optional SLA.</strong> If Reseller purchases an SLA, the SLA terms will apply only to the Customers covered by that SLA.</p>
<h2>6. INTELLECTUAL-PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>6.1 <strong>Trademark Licence.</strong>  Company grants Reseller a non-exclusive, revocable licence to use the Hivebase® marks solely to market the Services in accordance with Company’s brand guidelines.  </p>
<p>6.2 <strong>Ownership.</strong>  As between the Parties, Company retains all IP rights in the Services; Reseller retains all IP rights in its own services and marketing materials.</p>
<h2>7. COMPLIANCE &amp; DATA PROTECTION  </h2>
<p>7.1 <strong>Applicable Law.</strong>  Each Party will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its activities under this Addendum, including export-control, privacy, and data-protection laws.  </p>
<p>7.2 <strong>Privacy &amp; Security.</strong>  Company will protect Customer Content as described in the Base Terms and Privacy Policy. Reseller is responsible for any personal data it collects outside the Services (e.g., while scanning documents).  </p>
<p>7.3 <strong>Insurance.</strong>  Reseller shall maintain commercial general liability insurance with limits not less than US $1 million per occurrence.</p>
<h2>8. INDEMNIFICATION  </h2>
<p>8.1 <strong>By Reseller.</strong>  In addition to the indemnity in § 12.4 of the Base Terms, Reseller will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Company from any claim arising out of (a) Reseller’s scanning or handling of physical documents, or (b) Reseller’s breach of § 3.2.  </p>
<p>8.2 <strong>By Company.</strong> Company’s IP indemnity in § 12.5 of the Base Terms extends to Reseller and Reseller’s Customers.</p>
<h2>9. CUSTOMER-RELATIONSHIP PROTECTION  </h2>
<p>9.1 <strong>Reseller of Record</strong></p>
<p>For each paid Customer workspace that Reseller creates in the Services and that remains active, Reseller is the “Reseller of Record.”  Company will not knowingly solicit or accept a direct subscription from that Customer while Reseller remains the Reseller of Record for the workspace.</p>
<p>9.2 <strong>Non-Circumvention</strong></p>
<p>During the Term and for twelve (12) months thereafter, Company will not enter into a direct commercial agreement for the Services with a Customer for which Reseller is the Reseller of Record <strong>except</strong> as permitted under § 9.3. If a Customer contacts Company directly, Company will refer the Customer back to Reseller.</p>
<p>9.3 <strong>Permitted Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>Company may contract directly with the Customer only if:  </p>

<p>(c) <strong>Cessation of Business</strong> – Reseller ceases operations, enters insolvency proceedings, or otherwise notifies Company that it will no longer service the Customer; or  </p>
<p>(d) <strong>Regulatory or Security Requirement</strong> – direct engagement is reasonably necessary to comply with law or to address a security incident.</p>
<p>9.4  <strong>Notice &amp; Transition</strong></p>
<p>If an exception in § 9.3 applies, Company will (i) notify Reseller prior to onboarding the Customer directly (or, if prior notice is impracticable, promptly thereafter) and (ii) co-operate in good faith to transition the Customer in a manner that minimises disruption.</p>
<p>9.5  <strong>Non-Interference by Reseller</strong></p>
<p>Reseller will not prevent a Customer from exercising its rights under § 9.3, nor misrepresent the Parties’ respective responsibilities.</p>
<p>9.6  <strong>Survival</strong></p>
<p>This Section 9 survives termination of the Addendum for twelve (12) months.</p>
