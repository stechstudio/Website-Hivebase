By accepting this Addendum, Reseller confirms that it has read and agrees to be bound by its terms and by the Base Terms.

## 3. CUSTOMER ONBOARDING & FLOW-DOWN TERMS  
3.1  **Customer Acceptance of Base Terms**  
The Hivebase application requires every end user to accept the Base Terms and Privacy Policy at first login; Company is responsible for collecting and recording that acceptance.  **Reseller is solely responsible for establishing and enforcing any separate commercial or service-level terms between Reseller and its Customer, provided that such terms do not conflict with the Base Terms or this Addendum.**
3.2 **No Additional Warranties.**  Reseller shall not make any representation or warranty about the Services that is inconsistent with or in addition to the Base Terms or this Addendum.  
3.3 **Scanning & Physical Documents.**  If Reseller performs scanning, digitisation, or document-preparation services, Reseller is solely responsible for the physical documents and any loss or damage thereto.  Company bears no liability for physical document handling.
3.4 **Customer Content Ownership and Agency.**
(a)  Ownership.  As between Company, Reseller, and each Customer, all right, title, and interest in Customer Content (including documents digitised and uploaded by Reseller) remain with the Customer or its licensors.  Reseller makes no ownership claim to such Customer Content.  
(b)  Agency.  When Reseller uploads or otherwise processes Customer Content in a Customer workspace, Reseller acts solely as that Customer’s agent.  Reseller represents and warrants that it has all rights and permissions required to grant Company the licence described in § 2.3 of the Base Terms on the Customer’s behalf.  
(c)  Conflicting Instructions.  If Company receives conflicting instructions from Reseller and the Customer regarding Customer Content, Company may, at its sole discretion, follow the Customer’s instructions, require joint written direction, or suspend access to the disputed Content until the conflict is resolved.  
(d)  Indemnity.  Reseller will indemnify and hold harmless Company from any claim alleging that Reseller lacked authority to upload or process Customer Content or that Reseller’s handling of physical documents violated a third party’s rights.
## 4. FEES & PAYMENT  
4.1 **Plan Selection**
At onboarding (or later in the Reseller Console) Reseller must choose one of the following billing plans for each reseller account:
- **Monthly Auto-Billing Plan** (default)  
- **Annual Invoicing Plan**
The selected plan applies to all workspaces Reseller provisions under that reseller account until Reseller switches plans in the Reseller Console (switches take effect at the next renewal).
“Minimum Commitment” means the minimum spend per billing period displayed in the Reseller Console, if any.
4.2 **Monthly Auto-Billing Plan**
(a) **Payment Method.**  Reseller must maintain a valid credit-card or ACH payment method on file.  
(b) **Charge Schedule.**  Company will charge the payment method on or after the first business day of each calendar month for (i) the greater of actual usage fees or the Minimum Commitment for the preceding month, plus (ii) applicable taxes.  
(c) **Failed Payments.**  If a charge is declined, Reseller has seven (7) days to update the payment method; otherwise late-fee and suspension provisions in § 5 of the Base Terms apply.
4.3 **Annual Invoicing Plan**
(a) **Up-Front Invoice.**  For each new workspace Reseller activates, Company will issue an invoice for a 12-month subscription at the then-current wholesale price.  
(b) **Renewal Invoice.**  Company will issue a renewal invoice thirty (30) days before each workspace’s annual renewal date.  
(c) **Payment Terms.**  Invoices are due net thirty (30) days from the invoice date.  
(d) **Minimum Commitment.**  If a Minimum Commitment applies, Company will reconcile Reseller’s cumulative annual spend against that commitment at the end of each contract year and invoice any shortfall.
4.4 **Pricing & Minimum Commitment Changes**
Wholesale prices and any Minimum Commitment applicable to Reseller are displayed in the Reseller Console. Company may update these amounts on at least thirty (30) days’ written notice. Continued resale of the Services after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.
4.5 **Taxes, Late Fees & Interest**
Tax obligations, late-fee calculations, and interest on overdue amounts are governed by § 5 of the Base Terms.
4.6 **No Offset**
Reseller’s payment obligations to Company are independent of Reseller’s collection from Customers.  Reseller may not withhold or offset amounts owed to Company for any reason.
4.7 **Price Protection**
(a) **Standard Lock (12 Months).**  The wholesale price in effect for a workspace on its activation date is locked for twelve (12) months.  Company may not increase that workspace’s wholesale price during the 12-month lock.
(b)  **Extended Lock (Up to 36 Months).**  
If Reseller enters a customer contract term longer than 12 months, Reseller may flag the workspace in the Reseller Console within thirty (30) days of activation and record the contract-end date (which may not exceed thirty-six (36) months after activation).  The wholesale price for that workspace is then locked until the earlier of (i) the recorded contract-end date or (ii) thirty-six (36) months after activation.  
If the workspace is cancelled before its recorded contract-end date, Reseller shall pay an early-termination fee equal to the lesser of (A) three (3) months of wholesale fees for that workspace, or (B) the wholesale fees that would have been due for the remainder of the recorded contract term.
(c) **Post-Lock Pricing.**  After the applicable price-lock period ends, the workspace will renew at the then-current wholesale price unless otherwise agreed in writing.
(d) **Minimum Commitment Unaffected.**  Price protection applies per workspace and does not alter Reseller’s Minimum Commitment, if any.
(e) **Notice of Change.**  Company will continue to provide at least thirty (30) days’ notice of any wholesale price increase, but such increase will not take effect for a protected workspace until its lock period expires.
## 5. SUPPORT & SERVICE LEVELS
5.1 **First-Line Support.**  Reseller provides first-line support to its Customers.  Company will provide second-line support to Reseller during business hours at no additional charge.
