Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.

## 3. USER REPRESENTATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
By accessing or using the Services, you represent, warrant, and covenant, on a continuing basis, that:
1. **Accurate Information.**  All registration, billing, and contact information you provide is and will remain true, complete, and up-to-date.  You will promptly correct any inaccuracies.
2. **Legal Capacity; Age.**  You have the full legal right and authority to enter into these Legal Terms on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent, and you are at least eighteen (18) years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher).
3. **Compliance With Laws.**  You will at all times comply with (a) these Legal Terms, (b) all applicable domestic and international laws and regulations, including export-control and economic-sanctions laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and privacy laws, and (c) any applicable industry standards.
4. **No Prohibited or Regulated Data.**  You will not upload to, or process through, the Services any data that is subject to a specific regulatory or contractual handling regime (including but not limited to HIPAA, GLBA, or ITAR) unless you have first executed a separate written agreement with Company expressly permitting such use, as required by § 1.4 above.
5. **Content Rights.**  You have, and will maintain, all rights, licenses, and permissions necessary (i) to grant the license in § 2.3, and (ii) to upload, store, display, or otherwise process Customer Content through the Services, without infringing or misappropriating any third-party rights.
6. **No Automated or Unauthorized Access.**  You will not access or use the Services through automated means (bots, scripts, data-scrapers, etc.) except as expressly allowed by an API license from Company, nor will you attempt to circumvent technical or security controls.
7. **No Illegal, Harmful, or Unauthorized Use.**  You will not use the Services for any unlawful purpose or in any manner that could disable, overburden, damage, or impair the Services, interfere with anyone else’s use of the Services, or otherwise pose a security or legal risk to Company, its infrastructure providers, or other users.
If you breach—or Company reasonably suspects that you have breached—any representation in this Section 3, Company may, in its sole discretion and without notice, suspend or terminate your access to the Services pursuant to § 10 (Term and Termination).

## 4. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND SECURITY  
### 4.1 Account Registration  
Except for Guest Users who access the Services solely via a share link, every person who uses the Services must register as an **Authorized User** under a valid Customer or Reseller subscription.  Each Authorized User must have a unique login ID; account sharing is prohibited.
### 4.2 Accurate Registration Data  
You agree to provide true, complete, and current information when registering and to promptly update that information if it changes.  Company may reject or reclaim any username that violates these Legal Terms or applicable law.
### 4.3 Account Credentials and Optional MFA  
You must keep your login credentials confidential, and **account sharing is strictly prohibited**. Company offers multi-factor authentication (“**MFA**”); while MFA is optional, we strongly recommend enabling it to enhance account security.
### 4.4 Unauthorized Use or Breach  
You will immediately (i) disable compromised credentials and (ii) notify Company at security@hivebase.com if you become aware of any unauthorized access to your account or the Services.  Company may suspend access to preserve security.
### 4.5 Suspension or Termination for Security Risk  
Company may, without liability, suspend or terminate any account or disable access to specific Customer Content if (a) Company reasonably believes the account or content poses a security risk, infringes the rights of any third party, or violates § 1.4 (Prohibited Sensitive Data), or (b) Company is required to do so by law or court order. Company will, where practicable, notify the account owner and provide an opportunity to remedy the issue prior to suspension.
### 4.6 Transfer of Accounts  
Except with Company’s prior written consent, you may not transfer, assign, or resell your account or any seat to another person or entity. Any attempted transfer in violation of this Section 4.6 is null and void.

## 5. FEES, PAYMENT, AND CANCELLATION  
### 5.1  Subscription Structure  
The Services are sold on a subscription basis.  Fees are calculated from (a) the plan tier you select and (b) the number of Authorized User seats you provision, as recorded by the Services.  If your access to the Services is provisioned through a Reseller, your payment obligations—if any—are described in your agreement with that Reseller, and Company may look solely to the Reseller for fees. Unless stated otherwise in an online checkout page or separate Order Form, all fees are quoted and payable in U.S. dollars.
### 5.2  Free Trials  
If Company offers a free trial, you may use the Services without charge for the duration stated at signup.  Unless you cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid plan at the then-current list price.  
### 5.3  Automatic Renewal and Cancellation  
Each paid subscription renews automatically for successive periods equal to the initial term (e.g., monthly or annually) **unless** you cancel through the account-management portal or by written notice at least:  
&nbsp;(a) fifteen (15) days before the end of a monthly term; or  
&nbsp;(b) thirty (30) days before the end of an annual term.  
### 5.4  Price Changes  
Company may modify its list prices on at least thirty (30) days’ prior email notice.  Revised prices take effect at your next renewal.  If you do not agree to the change, you may cancel under § 5.3, and the new price will not apply for the remainder of your current term.
### 5.5  Taxes  
Fees are exclusive of all sales, use, value-added, withholding, or other taxes (“**Taxes**”).  You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your subscription, except for taxes on Company’s net income.  If Company is required to collect or pay Taxes, such Taxes will be added to your invoice and are due when invoiced.
### 5.6  Payment Method, Late Fees, and Suspension  
You authorize Company (or its payment processor) to charge your designated payment method on each billing due date.  Unpaid amounts accrue interest at one-and-one-half percent (1.5 %) per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the due date until paid.  Company may suspend access to the Services, after seven (7) days’ written notice, for any past-due balance.
### 5.7  Seat Responsibility  
You are financially responsible for every Authorized User seat provisioned under your subscription until the seat is de-provisioned in the Services, whether or not the individual user actively logs in or uses the Service.
### 5.8  Refund Policy  
Except where prohibited by applicable law, all payments are non-refundable once charged.  This § 5.8 does not limit any statutory cancellation or refund rights that the laws of your jurisdiction may provide.
### 5.9  Billing Disputes and Chargebacks  
You must notify Company in writing of any good-faith billing dispute within thirty (30) days of the disputed invoice date and cooperate diligently to resolve the dispute.  Initiating a card chargeback before following this process constitutes a material breach of these Legal Terms.

## 6. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES  
You agree not to, and will not permit any third party to, do any of the following (collectively, “**Prohibited Activities**”):
### 6.1 Illegal, Harmful, or Infringing Content  
(a) Upload, store, display, or transmit any Customer Content that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, harassing, hateful, or that encourages conduct that would violate applicable laws or regulations.  
(b) Upload or transmit any Customer Content that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any third-party intellectual-property or privacy rights.  
(c) Upload or process any information subject to special legal or contractual handling requirements (including PHI under HIPAA, cardholder data under PCI DSS, or export-controlled technical data under ITAR or EAR) except as expressly permitted under § 1.4.
### 6.2 Security Violations  
(d) Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or related systems or networks.  
(e) Probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Services, or breach, disable, or tamper with any security or authentication measures.  
(f) Introduce any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, time bombs, corrupted files, or other destructive code.
### 6.3 Service Integrity & Fair Use  
(g) Use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means to access the Services for any purpose without Company’s prior written consent.  
(h) Access the Services for purposes of monitoring availability, performance, functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purpose.  
(i) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying algorithms of the Services, except to the limited extent such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this prohibition.  
(j) Interfere with any other user’s enjoyment of the Services or disrupt the normal flow of dialogue.  
(k) Send unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, or any other form of duplicative or unsolicited messages.
### 6.4 Misuse of Accounts  
(l) Share, transfer, or otherwise make an Authorized User credential available to any person other than the specific individual to whom the credential was issued.  
(m) Create or use fake identities, impersonate another person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.
### 6.5 Export & Sanctions Compliance  
(n) Use the Services in violation of U.S. or other applicable export-control or economic-sanctions laws, including by providing access to embargoed countries or prohibited end users.
### 6.6 Enforcement  
Company reserves the right, but not the obligation, to investigate any Prohibited Activity and to remove or disable access to Customer Content or suspend accounts in accordance with § 4.5.  Company may also report any Prohibited Activity to law-enforcement authorities and cooperate with any investigation.
### 6.7 Reporting  
Suspected Prohibited Activity may be reported to Company at **abuse@hivebase.com**.
### 6.8 Third-Party Services 
Any digitization, scanning, or document-preparation services performed by a Reseller or other third party are independent of the Services. Company is not responsible for, and disclaims all liability arising from, such third-party services or the physical documents handled in connection therewith.

## 7. USER DATA: STORAGE, RETENTION, AND EXPORT  
### 7.1  Customer Control and Responsibility  
Customer (including, where applicable, Reseller) has sole responsibility for (a) the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Content, (b) establishing internal retention schedules that meet its regulatory or business obligations, and (c) maintaining its own backup or archive copies of Customer Content outside the Services if required for disaster-recovery or legal-hold purposes.
### 7.2  Storage and Redundancy  
Company stores Customer Content in geographic regions disclosed in its Security Overview and maintains commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards—including multiple redundant copies and routine integrity checks—to protect Customer Content from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure.
### 7.3  Data Retention During an Active Subscription  
So long as (i) Customer’s subscription remains active and in good standing and (ii) Customer has not chosen to delete specific documents or projects using the standard delete functions of the Services, Company will not intentionally delete Customer Content.
### 7.4  Customer-Initiated Deletion and Limited Recovery Window  
The Services allow Customer (or its Authorized Users with appropriate permissions) to delete specific documents or projects (“**Deleted Content**”).  Deleted Content is immediately removed from the live production environment and **should be treated by Customer as irretrievably lost**.  For disaster-recovery purposes only, Company retains encrypted backups that may include copies of Deleted Content for up to thirty (30) days after deletion (“**Recovery Window**”). 
During the Recovery Window, Customer may submit a written request to restore Deleted Content.  Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the requested data **but does not guarantee** that any Deleted Content can or will be recovered.  Company may charge a reasonable, mutually agreed professional-services fee for any restoration work.  After the Recovery Window expires, Deleted Content becomes subject to the deletion schedule in § 7.6.
### 7.5  Post-Termination Export Window  
Upon any termination or non-renewal of the subscription:  
- Customer may, for thirty (30) days following the termination effective date, download Customer Content via the self-service export tools at no additional charge; and  
- After that 30-day window, Company may delete or overwrite Customer Content in the ordinary course of business.  Company will, upon written request during the 30-day window, provide a one-time bulk export (encrypted archive) for a reasonable, mutually agreed professional-services fee.
### 7.6  Final Deletion from Backups  
After the events described in § 7.4 or § 7.5, Customer Content enters Company’s secure deletion workflow and is overwritten or otherwise rendered unrecoverable during Company’s standard backup-rotation and log-retention cycles.  These cycles are designed so that Customer Content is ordinarily removed from all active and archival storage in the ordinary course of business, subject to (i) retention in system logs for security auditing and (ii) preservation required by law, court order, or regulatory request.
### 7.7  Aggregated Usage Data  
Company may retain and use anonymized or aggregated data derived from Customer’s use of the Services for legitimate business purposes (such as improving product features and benchmarking), provided that such data cannot reasonably be used to identify Customer, Reseller, or any Authorized User.
### 7.8  Legal Holds and E-Discovery  
If Customer is subject to litigation, investigation, or other legal hold that requires preservation of specific Customer Content beyond the periods stated above, Customer must notify Company in writing before the applicable deletion date.  Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the identified data for the duration of the legal hold, and Customer will reimburse Company for any reasonable, documented costs incurred.
### 7.9  DISCLAIMER OF DATA-LOSS LIABILITY  
Except to the limited extent caused by Company’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, Company is **not liable** for any loss, corruption, or destruction of Customer Content (a) that results from Customer’s own actions or omissions, including use of the delete functions described in § 7.4, (b) that occurs after the 30-day post-termination export window, or (c) that results from a failure by Customer to maintain independent backups as required by § 7.1.

## 8. SERVICES MANAGEMENT  
### 8.1 Monitoring and Enforcement  
Company may monitor use of the Services to (a) operate, secure, and improve the Services; (b) verify compliance with these Legal Terms (including § 6 “Prohibited Activities”); and (c) detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or security threats.  Monitoring may include automated tools and human review, but Company has no obligation to monitor every transaction or file.
### 8.2 Protective Actions  
If Company reasonably determines that (i) Customer Content or account activity violates these Legal Terms, applicable law, or the rights of a third party, or (ii) continued access poses a security, performance, or legal risk to the Services or to any user, Company may take one or more of the following actions, each a **“Protective Action”**:  
1. **Content Measures.** Remove, disable, or limit access to the specific Customer Content at issue;  
2. **Account Measures.** Suspend or restrict the relevant Authorized User account(s) in whole or in part;  
3. **Technical Measures.** Throttle traffic or storage that is objectively excessive or disruptive to system stability;  
4. **Legal Measures.** Report the matter to law-enforcement or other competent authorities and cooperate with any investigation.
Except where prohibited by law or where immediate action is required to mitigate material risk, Company will provide Customer with **prior written notice** (email acceptable) describing the planned Protective Action and, where practicable, an opportunity to cure the violation.
### 8.3 Restoration  
If Customer cures the violation to Company’s reasonable satisfaction within the time period stated in the notice (or, if no period is stated, within ten (10) business days), Company will promptly restore suspended accounts or disabled Customer Content unless restoration would create a continuing risk described in § 8.2.
### 8.4 Excessive-Usage Safeguards  
The Services include usage thresholds described in the applicable plan documentation. If Customer’s usage materially exceeds those thresholds and degrades platform performance, Company may request that Customer purchase additional capacity or reduce usage to within allotted limits.  If Customer fails to do so within a commercially reasonable time after notice, Company may take Technical Measures under § 8.2(3).
### 8.5 Reservation of Rights  
Company reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Legal Terms, including the right to improve, modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services in accordance with § 11 (Modifications, Maintenance & Service Interruptions), provided that Company will not materially downgrade the core functionality of the Services without at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice to Customers on paid plans.

## 9. PRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION  
### 9.1  Incorporated Privacy Policy  
Your use of the Services is subject to the Hivebase Privacy Policy (https://www.hivebase.com/privacy), which is incorporated by reference. By using the Services, you confirm that you have reviewed the Privacy Policy.
### 9.2  Hosting Regions  
Customer Content is stored and processed in the hosting region associated with your workspace—either the United States **or** Canada. We endeavor to keep all Customer Content within that region. In limited circumstances (for example, remote support, disaster-recovery operations, or the engagement of ancillary subprocessors), Customer Content may be accessed from other jurisdictions, but always under the safeguards described in our Privacy Policy.
### 9.3  Security Commitment  
We maintain an information-security program with administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect Customer Content against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Additional security details are provided in the Privacy Policy.
### 9.4  Document Hierarchy  
If any term in the Privacy Policy conflicts with these Legal Terms, these Legal Terms will control, except where applicable law requires otherwise.

## 10. TERM & TERMINATION  
### 10.1 Term  
These Legal Terms start on the earlier of (a) the date you create an account or (b) the effective date of an Order Form, and continue until all subscriptions governed by these Legal Terms have expired or been terminated (the “Term”).
### 10.2 Termination by Customer for Convenience  
Customer may terminate its subscription(s) at any time through the account-management portal or by written notice, in each case subject to the advance-notice periods in § 5.3.  Termination under this § 10.2 does not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all fees that became due prior to the termination effective date.
### 10.3 Termination for Cause  
Either party may terminate these Legal Terms immediately on written notice if the other party:  
1. **Material Breach.**  Fails to cure a material breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice that specifies the breach; or  
2. **Insolvency.**  Becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or similar proceeding that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days.  
**Non-Payment & Security Breach.**  Company may terminate or suspend the Services on seven (7) days’ written notice for unpaid amounts under § 5.6, or immediately if Customer’s use of the Services poses a security risk described in § 8.2.
### 10.4 Effect of Termination  
Upon termination or expiration:  
- **Access.**  All rights to access or use the Services cease immediately;  
- **Fees.**  Any unpaid fees through the termination effective date become due and payable;  
- **Export.**  Customer’s ability to export Customer Content is governed by § 7.5; and  
- **Deletion.**  Customer Content will be deleted in accordance with § 7.6.
### 10.5 Survival  
Sections 1, 2, 3, 5.6–5.9, 6, 7, 8.5, 9, 10.4–10.5, 11 (Modifications, Maintenance & Service Interruptions), 12 (Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability & Indemnification), 13 (Dispute Resolution & Governing Law), and 14 (Miscellaneous) survive any termination or expiration of these Legal Terms.

## 11. MODIFICATIONS, MAINTENANCE & SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS  
### 11.1  Continuous Improvement  
We continually improve the Services and may add, modify, or remove features (each a “**Change**”).  Except as provided in § 11.2, we will not make a Change that materially reduces the core document-management functionality of the Services during your current Subscription Term.
### 11.2  Notice of Material Changes  
If we intend to make a Change that, in our reasonable judgment, materially diminishes or discontinues a core feature you are actively using, we will give at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice (email acceptable).  Within that notice period you may terminate the Subscription Term for convenience and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid, unused fees covering the remainder of the Term.
### 11.3  Scheduled Maintenance  
We perform routine maintenance **outside normal business hours—defined as 08:00–18:00 Monday through Friday in the continental United States and Canada (local time at the affected datacenter) or at any time on a weekend**. When a maintenance activity is expected to cause more than fifteen (15) minutes of service interruption, we will give at least forty-eight (48) hours’ advance notice. Emergency maintenance to address critical issues (for example, security vulnerabilities) may occur at any time; if advance notice is impracticable, we will notify affected customers as soon as reasonably possible afterward.
### 11.4  Service Interruptions  
We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted service.  Outages can arise from factors beyond our reasonable control—including internet-backbone failures, force-majeure events per § 11.6, or third-party service disruptions.  Your sole remedy for unplanned downtime is the right to terminate under § 10.3 if the outage constitutes a material breach that we fail to cure within thirty (30) days, **unless a separate, written Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) between you and Company provides otherwise.**
### 11.5  Beta Features  
We may label certain functionality as “beta,” “preview,” or “early access.”  Such features are provided **AS IS**, may be modified or withdrawn at any time, and are excluded from any warranties or uptime commitments stated elsewhere in these Legal Terms.
### 11.6  Force Majeure  
Neither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations (excluding payment obligations) caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes, government actions, utility failures, or internet-service-provider outages.  The affected party will promptly notify the other and use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact.
### 11.7  Communications  
Notices under this Section 11 will be sent to the email address associated with your account’s primary administrator and, where feasible, posted to the Hivebase status page (https://status.hivebase.com).

## 12. DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY & INDEMNIFICATION  
### 12.1  Disclaimers  
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE LEGAL TERMS, THE SERVICES AND ALL RELATED MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED **“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,”** WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY.  COMPANY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES; SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
### 12.2  Limitation of Liability  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
SUBJECT TO § 12.3, EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES, THESE LEGAL TERMS, OR ANY ORDER FORM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED **THE GREATER OF (i) THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO COMPANY FOR THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, OR (ii) FIFTY THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US $50,000). **The foregoing limitations apply in the aggregate to all claims brought by Customer and its Affiliates, including where Customer acts as a Reseller on behalf of downstream customers.
### 12.3  Exceptions
